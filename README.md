# Aegis

**Ask questions about company policies and get clear, cited answers.**

Only people who are allowed to see a document can get answers from it. Every answer quotes the exact sentence it came from. Old policies are not treated as current. Every question is logged.

---

Aegis is a RAG assistant for internal company documents (leave policy, security policy, travel rules, refunds, etc.). Employees type a normal question and get an answer with sources. People from other departments and guests never see restricted files.

Access control is applied in the database **before** any search runs. A document the user cannot read is never retrieved and never shown to the AI.

## What it does

A company has departments (HR, finance, engineering, support). Each owns its own documents. Employees should be able to ask questions instead of searching through shared drives — while keeping sensitive documents protected.

- **Access control** — Public, internal, and restricted documents. Guests see only public content. Employees see public + internal + restricted documents from their own department.
- **Exact quotes** — Every claim in the answer must copy a real sentence from the document. Fake quotes are rejected.
- **Versions** — Policies can exist as active and superseded versions. The system uses the correct one.
- **Audit trail** — Every question is saved (who asked, what they asked, which sources were used).

## Quick start

```bash
# Start the database
docker compose up -d

# Set your OpenAI key
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and add:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://rag:ragsecret@localhost:5433/ragdb

# Run the app
uv run uvicorn assistant.api:app --reload
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

Upload policy files through the web page and ask questions as different users.

### Demo users

| User  | Department   | What they can see                          |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| alice | engineering  | Public + internal + engineering-only docs  |
| bob   | hr           | Public + internal + HR-only docs           |
| carol | finance      | Public + internal + finance-only docs      |
| guest | none         | Public documents only                      |

## How it works

1. **Check the question** — Is this about the current rule or an older version?
2. **Search** — Look only in the documents this person can read. Combines AI search and keyword search.
3. **Pick the best results** — Rank them and drop weak ones.
4. **Write the answer** — Use only the text that was found. Every claim must include an exact quote.
5. **Check the quotes** — Verify every quote really appears in the source (done in code, not by the AI).
6. **Save a log** — Record the question, the user, and the sources used.

## Main features

- **Access control before search** — Restricted documents never leave the database for unauthorized users.
- **Hybrid search** — Combines AI (vector) search and normal keyword search for better results.
- **Better ranking** — A second AI step scores the results and drops low-quality ones.
- **Exact quotes only** — Answers must copy real sentences. Ungrounded claims are rejected.
- **Document versions** — Active and superseded policies can coexist. The system chooses the right one.
- **No duplicate uploads** — Uploading the same content twice does nothing. Changing the content replaces the old version.
- **Audit log** — Every question is saved with who asked it and which sources were used.
- **Trace** — You can see exactly what happened for each question (how many chunks were searchable, what was retrieved, etc.).
- **Warnings** — Old documents or superseded versions trigger a warning on the answer.

## How to format a policy file

Every uploaded file must start with this header:

```markdown
---
title: Leave policy
department: hr
visibility: internal
version: 1
status: active
effective: 2026-06-30
updated: 2026-06-30
---

# Leave policy

## How many leaves
...
```

- **visibility**: `public`, `internal`, or `restricted`
- **status**: `active` or `superseded`
- Title + version is the document’s identity

## Who can see what

| Visibility   | Who can read it                |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| public       | Anyone (including guests)      |
| internal     | Any employee                   |
| restricted   | Only people in that department |

This check happens in the database before search. The AI never sees documents the user is not allowed to read.
